# Hotel/AirBnb Booking simulator
This C++ code is a simulation of the basic functions of a real booking system for a hotel or an AirBnb. It allows the user to book rooms, look for available rooms, the reservations they have made, cancel reservations and manage them. The simulation provides the basic procedures to simulate the booking process to help understand and have a small idea of how real booking or renting platforms work.
